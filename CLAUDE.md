# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the content repository for **Dartmouth CS52: Full-Stack Web Development** (Winter 2026). It contains course materials managed by the classmoji platform and exported from Notion.

## Structure

- `.classmoji/manifest.json` - Defines course modules, assignments, page mappings, and slide references
- `pages/` - Contains HTML pages and assets for each assignment/topic
  - Each subdirectory has an `index.html` and optional `assets/` folder

## Manifest Structure

The manifest organizes content into modules with pages, slides (reveal.js), and assignments:
- **Labs**: lab-1 through lab-5 (landing page, quiz, react-notes, platform frontend/API)
- **Short Assignments (SA)**: sa0-sa6 (hello-world, starterpack, react intro, routing, state management, kahoot API)
- **Projects**: project-1 through project-7 (team milestones from first meeting to final submission)
- **Extra Credit (ECSA)**: git-map, websockets, react-native, image uploads, API testing, authentication
- **General**: standalone pages like logistics, projects overview, and cypress testing intro

## Content Formats

**Pages**: HTML files with inline CSS styling, featuring:
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting (`.code-block`)
- Terminal blocks for command examples (`.terminal-block`)
- Callouts/alerts for important information
- Profile cards, embedded videos, and images in `assets/` directories

**Slides**: Reveal.js presentations (referenced in manifest but stored/managed separately)

## No Build System

This is a static content repository. Content is authored in Notion and exported to HTML by classmoji.

## For AI Assistants (Syllabusmoji)

### Content Structure
- `pages/{slug}/` - HTML pages with index.html
- `slides/{slug}-{timestamp}/` - Reveal.js slide decks (e.g., `html-1767722677121/`)
- `.classmoji/manifest.json` - Maps short slugs to content locations

### Draft vs Published Content
Content exists in this repo but may not be **published** yet in the database.
- You can READ content here to answer questions about it
- But when creating LINKS, you must check publish status first
- **Use `query_available_content` tool** to get published content IDs

### When Asked About Slides/Pages/Assignments
1. **To answer questions about content**: Read from this repo (secure_read, secure_glob)
2. **To create clickable links**: Use `query_available_content` to get published IDs
   - For pages: use page ID (UUID) with referenceType='page'
   - For slides: use slide ID (UUID) with referenceType='slides'
   - For assignments: get linkedPageIds and use referenceType='page'
3. **Never fabricate paths or IDs** - always use exact ID values from query_available_content
4. If content exists here but isn't published, you can describe it but say "link not yet available"

### Reading the Manifest
The manifest at `.classmoji/manifest.json` shows the content structure:
- `modules.{module}.assignments.{slug}.slides` - slides linked to assignments
- `general.slides` - standalone slides
Use these slugs for understanding content, but get IDs from `query_available_content` for links.

## AI Code Citation

When generating or modifying code in student assignments, always include a citation comment:

```javascript
// Generated by Claude - YYYY-MM-DD
// Prompt: "brief description of what was requested"
```

This helps students track AI-generated code and maintain academic integrity per the course code policy.
